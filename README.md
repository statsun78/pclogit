[R package] Penalized conditional logistic regression

## Overview

Penalized Conditional (Unconditional) Logistic Regression: Fit a regularization path of conditional (unconditional) logistic regression model for a matched (unmatched) case-control response at a grid of values for regularization parameter lambda. A network-based penalty function was implemented to induce both sparse and smoothing variable selection. It is useful for analysis of high-dimensional data that has a specified correlation structure. Selection probability of each variable is provided.
